This is the 2024-2025 MHS Robotics GitHub!

The repo contains our current code for the 2025 Botball competition in the "Botball_2025" folder.(To be done)

For KIPR:
Files labeled "2025BotballPoms" and "2025BotballWombat2" are the code files for the Malden High School Robotics Team, Number:574.

This repo also consists of old cold that we took "inspiration" from for our current code.

Please do mind some of the file names in the old code!
